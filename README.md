# Containers Are Dead - Long Live WebAssembly

Welcome to **"Containers Are Dead - Long Live WebAssembly"**!

> In this course, we will explore the concept of containers and how they are being replaced by WebAssembly. We will cover the basics of WebAssembly, including its architecture and how it can be used to create lightweight, portable, and efficient applications. We will also discuss the benefits of using WebAssembly over traditional container technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes.

We assume you are familiar with the basics of Rust but we will provide brief explanations and references whenever we rely on advanced features.

## Getting started

Open [the companion book for this course](https://rust-exercises.com/rust-python-interop/) in your browser.
Follow the instructions there to get started.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).\
  If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how
  you installed Rust on your system)
  to make sure you're running on the latest stable version.
- _(Optional but recommended)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
  We recommend one of the following:
  - [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with
    the [`rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension.

## Solutions

You can find the solutions to the exercises in
the [`solutions` branch](https://github.com/mainmatter/containers-are-dead/tree/solutions) of this repository.

- Chapter 01: Basics (1.5 hours)
  goals:
    - understand the wasm format, and concepts
    - understand how to build wasm apps in rust
    - understand how to run wasm apps locally
    - understand the limitations (missing crate support, missing host support)
  exercises:
    - 1.1: setup
    - 1.2: basic wasm32-unknown-unknown module (TODO what should this module do?)
      goal: understand the wasm32-unknown-unknown target, understand its output, and its limitations.
      exercise: implement a simple tokenizer that reads arithmetic expressions from a string and parses them.
    - 1.3: basic wasm32-wasip2 app that reads command-line arguments (what should the app do with the arguments?)
      goal: understand the wasm32-wasip2/wasip2/wasip3 target, its advantages over wasm32-unknown-unknown, the basics of the component model, and its current limitations.
      - how to compile the component
      - execute with wasmtime
      exercise: use the tokenizer from before and adapt it to use proper Rust types. Extend the tokenizer to evaluate expressions. read expressions from stdin and print to stdout
- Chapter 02: Building Real Server-Side Applications (3 hours)
  goals:
    - 2.1: cloud hosting providers
      - serverless functions
      - spin framework?
      - install `spin` and install `spin-test` plugin
        ```
        spin plugin install -u https://github.com/spinframework/spin-test/releases/download/canary/spin-test.json
        ```
      exercise: compile and run the simple hello world http handler
    - 2.2: HTTP requests with the spin framework
      goal: demonstrate easy to use, serverless nature, understand permissions, and the manifest
      exercise: fix an http endpoint to return random numbers
    - 2.2: HTTP handlers proper
      goal: understand error handling in wasm components
      exercise: integrate the expression evaulator to evaluate POSTed expressions
    - 2.3: Key Value Store
      goal: demonstrate how simple values can be stored across calls and the usefulness of that. demonstrate limitations. but emphasize cross-platform support.
      exercise: expand expression evaluator to support assigning values to variables. Store the variables in the spin-sdk KV store.
    - 2.2: Routing
      goal: understand how in-component routing works, understand how composition works, understand how inter-component routing works
      - point to Rust + Go demo for inter-language composition
      exercise: expand expression evaluator to support assigning values to variables. Store the variables in the spin-sdk KV store.
- Chapter 03: Advanced (1.5 hours)
  goals:
    - 3.1: Observability
    goal: with hosted code, host performance becomes a critical part, show off the otel integration. Demonstrate current limitations (i.e. no support for guest o11y).
    - 3.1: Performance Optimization
      - size optimizations (--release, no_std, wasm-opt)
      - runtime optimizations (pre-evaluation of modules)
