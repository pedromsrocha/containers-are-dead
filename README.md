# Containers Are Dead - Long Live WebAssembly

Welcome to **"Containers Are Dead - Long Live WebAssembly"**!

> In this course, we will explore the concept of containers and how they are being replaced by WebAssembly. We will cover the basics of WebAssembly, including its architecture and how it can be used to create lightweight, portable, and efficient applications. We will also discuss the benefits of using WebAssembly over traditional container technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes.

We assume you are familiar with the basics of Rust but we will provide brief explanations and references whenever we rely on advanced features.

## Getting started

Open [the companion book for this course](https://rust-exercises.com/rust-python-interop/) in your browser.
Follow the instructions there to get started.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).\
  If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how
  you installed Rust on your system)
  to make sure you're running on the latest stable version.
- _(Optional but recommended)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
  We recommend one of the following:
  - [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with
    the [`rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension.

## Solutions

You can find the solutions to the exercises in
the [`solutions` branch](https://github.com/mainmatter/containers-are-dead/tree/solutions) of this repository.

- Chapter 02: Building Real Server-Side Applications (3 hours)
  goals:
  - 2.5: Routing
    goal: understand how in-component routing works, understand how composition works, understand how inter-component routing works
    - point to Rust + Go demo for inter-language composition
      exercise: expand expression evaluator to support assigning values to variables. Store the variables in the spin-sdk KV store.
- Chapter 03: Advanced (1.5 hours)
  goals:
  - 3.1: Observability
    goal: with hosted code, host performance becomes a critical part, show off the otel integration. Demonstrate current limitations (i.e. no support for guest o11y).
  - 3.1: Performance Optimization
    - size optimizations (--release, no_std, wasm-opt)
    - runtime optimizations (pre-evaluation of modules)
